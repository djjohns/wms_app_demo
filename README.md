# wms_app

This is a demo app to showcase a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containerized
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) webapp. That uses
[Python](https://www.python.org/), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/),
[bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/), and
[particlesjs](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) for the front and
backend. Along with offering an API using the
[django rest framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).
All to render some forms to an authenticated user to do some basic CRUD
operations.

This is a constant work in progress, and will be added to and remixed with other
tech stacks that I wish to explore.
